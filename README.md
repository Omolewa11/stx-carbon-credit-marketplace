## Data Structures
**Credit Balances**
A map to track the balance of carbon credits for each owner:
```
  (define-map credit-balances { owner: principal } { amount: uint })
```

**Credit Metadata**
A map that holds metadata for each carbon credit issued:
```
  (define-map credit-metadata 
    { credit-id: uint } 
    { 
      issuer: principal,
      vintage-year: uint,
      verification-standard: (string-ascii 64),
      project-type: (string-ascii 64),
      amount: uint
    }
  )
```

**Listings**
A map to manage active credit listings for sale:
```
  (define-map listings 
    { listing-id: uint } 
    {
      seller: principal,
      credit-id: uint,
      amount: uint,
      price-per-credit: uint,
      active: bool
    }
  )
```

**Identifiers**
Two data variables to track the next available credit and listing IDs:
```
  (define-data-var next-credit-id uint u1)
  (define-data-var next-listing-id uint u1)
```

**Error Handling**
The contract utilizes assertions and error handling to ensure that invalid operations are rejected with clear error messages.

**Usage**
To interact with this contract, users will typically follow these steps:

- Minting Credits: The owner can mint new carbon credits using the mint-credits function.
